# Restaurant Network - Database (Mateusz Markiewicz, Micha≈Ç Lisicki, Jakub Nowak)

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal is to create a **RestaurantNetwork** database to manage the operations of a restaurant chain. This system allows for monitoring key aspects such as restaurant locations, employee management, customer tracking, supplier coordination, inventory management, and transaction logging.

## üìã Assumptions

* Storing information about restaurant locations (addresses, activity status)
* Managing employees (positions, salaries, transfers, training)
* Tracking customers (personal data, loyalty points)
* Ingredient management (allergens, unit prices)
* Monitoring menu items (dishes, ingredients, recipes)
* Storing customer reviews and ratings
* Logging transactions and order details

## ‚ú® Features

* Employee salary management
* Preventing schedule conflicts with employee leave
* Low stock level warnings
* Blocking transactions at inactive restaurants
* Automatic inventory updates after transactions

## üö´ Limitations

* No multi-currency support
* No online order management
* No automated inventory replenishment
